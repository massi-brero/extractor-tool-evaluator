# Manual for the Semantic Extractor Evaluation (SEE) Software #

## 1. Introduction ##

The software named in the title of this manual is a part of a bachelor thesis developed for Fernuni Hagen germany ([www.fernuni-hagen.de](www.fernuni-hagen.de)). The software was written in Java.

### 1.1 Goals ###

The goals of the SEE software are basically:
1. Evaluate the results of concept extraction of a set of extractor software.
2. Measure the performance of the extractors in an standarzised extraction process.
3. Emphasize reproducibility for all experiments  based on the [PRIMAD](http://sigir.org/files/forum/2016J/p068.pdf) model.

### 1.2 Requirements ###

1. Linux distribution as OS
2. Java > 1.8
3. Git
4. [CRAFT Corpus](#1.2.1)
5. The currently supported [extractors](#1.2.2)
6. [TREC evaluation tool](http://trec.nist.gov/trec_eval/)

####<a name="1.2.1"></a>1.2.1 Gold Standard####

The currently used gold standard is the [CRAFT Corpus 2.0](http://bionlp-corpora.sourceforge.net/CRAFT/). consisting of 64 bio-medical full texts about genetic research. The publications used are taken from from the extensive source for scientific publications [PUBMED](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).
The corpus is used as a reference point for evaluating the results and the performance provided by the tested extractors. In the CRAFT Corpus concepts of 8 ontologies have  been extracted by domain experts. SEE currently uses the NCBI taxonomy results.
The extraction results in the Craft corpus are wrapped in several document types. SEE uses the XML files. After [downloading](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bionlp-corpora/files/CRAFT/v2.0/craft-2.0.tar.gz/download) the Craft Corpus the result files should be unzipped in this directory (seen from the SEE source folder):
|-- {SEE directory} 
|-- resources 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-- goldstandard  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-- craft 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-- craft-2.0 


#### <a name="1.2.2"></a>1.2.2 The extractors ####

At the moment SEE supports 3 extractors:
* [MetaMap]
* [cTakes]
* [QuickUMLS]

See also here for more detailed information.
To add more extrators to test you simply have to extend the extractors factory class and override 2/3 methods to tell the parser where to find the concepts in the result file generated by the extraction process.
[...]

To use the previously mentioned extractors please install them in this folders in the same directory as the SEE software:
|-- {SEE directory} 
|-- extractors 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-- metamap 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-- ctakes 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-- quickumls 

Please take a look at the following tips and cavears when installing the currently supported extractors.

###### Used ontologies ######

Most extractors can be customized to use a limited set of (mostly) UMLS ontologies. The current SEE version uses the NBCI taxonomy which was also used in the CRAFT gold standard corpus.

###### UMLS installation #####

MetaMap, QuickUMLS and cTakes need a UMLS installation of the ontologies that the extractors will use for the parsing process.
You can find a How-to and some basic instructions at the [UMLS site](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/quickstart.html);
You need a NIH account to use UMLS (and some extractors will also ask you for those credentials).

###### QuickUMLS ######

Quick UMLS is based on python and you will have to install some additional libraries dealing with language processing (most importantly [Simstring](http://www.chokkan.org/software/simstring)):

1. [Clone](https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/QuickUMLS.git) QUICKUMLS from its github repository
2. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/QuickUMLS) for installation.

[...]

###### cTakes ######

[cTakes](http://ctakes.apache.org/) is quite a complex software for analyzing biomedical texts. It can do much more than extracting concepts from UMLS vocabularies.
First you have to [download](http://ctakes.apache.org/downloads.cgi) and install cTakes (version 4.x). Please follow the installation [instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CTAKES/cTAKES+4.0+User+Install+Guide) for users.

** Customizing ctakes with own ontologies **

1. You need a UMLS installation consisting of RFF files.
2. Create custom dictionary with your ontology. use cTakes Dictionary Creator for that. See here for [details]( https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CTAKES/Dictionary+Creator+GUI).
3. Customize an annotator (in /desc/ctakes-dictionary-lookup-fast or /desc/ctakes-dictionary-lookup-fast). Save an custom descriptor.
4. Customize a clinical pipeline descriptor like /home/massi/projects/resources/extractors/ctakes/apache-ctakes-4.0.0/desc/ctakes-clinical-pipeline/desc/analysis_engine/AggregatePlaintextUMLSProcessor.xml -> insert your custom annotator.
5. reduce pipeline steps to remove any not wanted analysis from yout output (and maybe speeding up the process...?)
6. start the annotation run with bin/runctakesCPE.sh

Extremely important: Add the following type definition to the most primitive descriptor (or your custom annotator)    
<pre>&lt;typeSystemDescription&gt;
    	&lt;imports&gt;
            &lt;import&gt; name="org.apache.ctakes.typesystem.types.TypeSystem"/>
	&lt;/imports&gt;
&lt;/typeSystemDescription&gt;
</pre>

## 2 Using the SEE ##

The SEE can be used via command line. The following sctions explain the possible commands and the parameters needed.

The parsed concepts from an extractor result file stored can be stored in two different ways:
1. in a MySQL table (see table annotations)
2. In a TREC result file format that can be used for generating Information Retrieval figures

The gold standard can also be stores in the two ways mentioned above. But the annotations will be stored in the TREC qrel file format.

There is no need to create a tables or the database structure. This will be done automatically by the hibernate persistance module.

### 2.1 Set-up ###
If the requirements mentioned in the [according chapter]() are met there is only one more thing to do: entering the credentials for the MySQL database in the hibernate configuration file {your-SEE-project-root}/src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml:
<pre>
    &lt;session-factory&gt;
        ...
        &lt;property name="connection.username"&gt;root&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;property name="connection.password"&gt;123456&lt;/property&gt;

        ...
	&lt;session-factory&gt;
</pre>

Please repeat this for the test database for the unit and integration tests. The file structure is the same and the hibernate confug file can be found in {your-SEE-project-root}/src/test/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml


### 2.2 Reading a gold standard###

### 2.3 Starting a test run###

#### 2.3.1 The test run pipeline####

#### 2.3.2 Starting individual tasks of the pipeline ####

It is also possible to execute individual tasks of the pipeline described in 2.2.1(??).

## 3. Executing and using the unit tests ##
